# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus is on initializing the project structure and setting up the memory bank.

## Recent Changes

- Switched the API from OpenRouter to Google Gemini.
- Updated `manifest.json` with the new host permissions.
- Refactored the API call in `popup.js` to use the correct `fetch` syntax for the Gemini API, including the `x-goog-api-key` header and the `gemini-1.5-flash` model.

## Next Steps

- Test the new API integration to ensure it works as expected.
